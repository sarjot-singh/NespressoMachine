# NespressoMachine
A Nespresso Coffee Machine created entirely in SolidWorks.

This is still a work-in-progress, plan to create more realistic renders in blender software as well as mimic motorized parts that was based off of the original nespresso product.

# Latest Updates
September 2021
Currently working on improving the motor within the coffee machine. Will be redesigning the black portion that connects with the top of the nespresso machine. As of now this portion only has a face to face mate. However, I would like to create a gear mate that allows this part to move freely on its own as the coffee machine opens.
